Tools for combining disparate documents and images into a single PDF document with formatting .

## Formatting
This project uses __Black__ (https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) for code formatting. 
Before pushing new code, run `make format` to format code according to __Black's__ standards else CI checks will fail.
